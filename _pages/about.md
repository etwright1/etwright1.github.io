I am a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, where I research what happens when space debris comes back down to Earth, and what we can do about it.

I'm also a Junior Fellow of the Outer Space Institute, a network of interdisciplinary experts addressing emerging challenges in outer space.

In my spare time I am a director of SpaceCareers.uk, a website founded in 2015 that helps people find careers in the UK space sector.
